## Employee Attrition Prediction

This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical HR data to determine the likelihood of employees leaving the organization, helping HR departments take proactive actions.

### 📊 Features

* Data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Exploratory data analysis
* Model training using classification algorithms
* Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

### 🧰 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

### 📁 Project Structure

```

```

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EmployeeAttritionPrediction.git
   cd EmployeeAttritionPrediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook EmployeeAttritionPrediction.ipynb
   ```

### 🧪 Model Overview

The notebook compares different classifiers and selects the best one based on performance metrics. It also discusses important features affecting attrition, visualizations, and conclusions.

### ✅ Results

* Final model accuracy: \~92% (update after final run)
* Most important factors: Job Role, Environment Satisfaction, Overtime, etc.
